# flNeuronTool
A fast light neuron tracing and editing tool
The flNeuronTool allows users to reconstruct and proofread neuronal morphologies in light microscopy images. The system incorporates automatic tracing and manual editing of neuron reconstruction into a cooperative 3D interactive visualization-assisted environment, which is a powerful tool for analysis of complex neuronal images.
